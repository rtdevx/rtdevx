## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Bob**.

<p align="center">
ðŸŒ± I am currently learning: <b>DevOps</b>, <b>GitOps</b>, <b>Ansible</b> and <b>Kubernetes</b>.
</p>

I aim to learn how to implement a **GitOps** workflow for managing **Kubernetes** infrastructure, leveraging **Ansible** for provisioning and configuration management, with all code and automation version-controlled in GitHub.

## DevOps Tools and Technologies used in my homelab

- **Ansible** - end-to-end Linux Automation.
- **FluxCD** - keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.
- **GitHub** - source and version control.
- **Kubernetes** - container orchestration engine.
- **K3s** - fully compliant Kubernetes distribution.
- **PowerShell** - used for Windows 11 Bootstraping.
- **Proxmox Virtual Environment** - virtualization platform to host my homelab.
