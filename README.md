## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Bob**.

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on: ![My homelab](https://github.com/rtdevx/homelab/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#homelab-configuration).
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: ![DevOps / GitOps / Ansible and Kubernetes](https://github.com/rtdevx/homelab/tree/main/ansible/site#readme).

I aim to implement a ![GitOps](https://github.com/rtdevx/homelab/tree/main/ansible/site#configure-gitops) workflow for managing Kubernetes infrastructure, leveraging Ansible for provisioning and configuration management, with all code and automation version-controlled in GitHub.
