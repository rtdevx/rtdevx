## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Bob**.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning: **DevOps**, **GitOps**, **Ansible** and **Kubernetes**.

I aim to implement a **GitOps** workflow for managing **Kubernetes** infrastructure, leveraging **Ansible** for provisioning and configuration management, with all code and automation version-controlled in GitHub.
