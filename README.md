## Hi there 👋

My name is **Bob**.

- 🌱 I am currently learning: **DevOps**, **GitOps**, **Ansible** and **Kubernetes**.

I aim to implement a **GitOps** workflow for managing **Kubernetes** infrastructure, leveraging **Ansible** for provisioning and configuration management, with all code and automation version-controlled in GitHub.

## Technologies used in my homelab

- **Ansible** - end-to-end Linux Automation.
- **FluxCD** - for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.
- **Kubernetes** - container orchestration engine.
- **K3s** - a fully compliant Kubernetes distribution.
- **Powershell** - Windows 11 Bootstraping.
- **Proxmox Virtual Environment** - virtualization platform to host my homelab.
